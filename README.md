# Kyogas 
*(it's actually spelled "kiógas")*

Kyogas (file extension .`kyo`) is a minimalistic markup language with static typing that I made because I didn't have anything better to do. And because JSON is too verbose and I despise YAML using indentation for everything.


## Why should I use it?
Kyogas was made mainly as a personal project,  but if you're interested in it, here are some advantages:
- No bloaty syntax 
- Easy and fast to type
- Intuitive error codes that actually tell you what went wrong
- Static typing
- and a lot more to come!

# Syntax
Comments are only inline and marked with `|`
As mentioned before, Kyogas has static typing, which means that every key has a set type. 

Types are mostly intuitive, but for clarification purposes, here is a small table:

|  Kyogas    |    C#    |
|------------|----------|
|  str       |  string  |
|  int       |  int     |
|  flt       |  float   |
|  uint      |  uint    |
|  byte      |  byte    |
|  bool      |  bool    |
|  arr<type> | type[]   |

## Arrays

Arrays must have the `<-` prefix, otherwise the parser will throw an error.

Valid: `arr<str> <-things` invalid: `arr<str> things`.

Arrays are closed with `->`

***Please note that the closing line MUST be the array terminator ONLY. If there are random characters after or before it, the parser will throw an error.***

### Valid vs Invalid Arrays

Invalid: 
```
arr<str> <-showcase
    "super cool"
    "and awesome"
    "strings should"
    "go here"
    "!!!!"
-> hi mom!!
```

(notice the random string trailing the closing `->` symbol)

Valid:

```
arr<str> <-showcase
    "super cool"
    "and awesome"
    "strings should"
    "go here"
    "!!!!"
->
```

## Dictionaries

Yeah, dicts... we *DO* have those now!

Dictionaries are technically in the form of Objects, but they should work for all your dictionary needs.

Example object for a sword: 

```
obj sword <==
    int dmg: 45
    flt range: 6.7
    str name: "Sword"
    byte cost: 255
==>
```

## Null
You can assign the equivalent to `null` to a key with the `empty` keyword:
`str name: empty` = `string name = null;`

# Example snippet
A player save file for an RPG

```
str name: player
byte lvl: 5
uint gold: 358
uint xp: 44
byte hp: 100
byte max-hp: 100
byte defense: 4
byte attack: 45
```

Kyogas compiles into C# variables. We are still working on functionality to turn C# objects into Kyogas, however.
